# Cpp-Football-Tournament
# Final Project of the Computer Science Fundamentals Course

Hello,

This is the final project for the course *Computer Science and Programming Fundamentals*, completed at the end of the first semester of university.

The project simulates a type of football league and has been implemented in **C++**. A document explaining the implementation details has been uploaded. By reading it, you will understand the internal logic and structure of the code.

Each phase includes several input and output test cases. You can test them by running `main.cpp` in an IDE such as **CLion**, entering the provided inputs, and verifying that the output matches the expected results.

(Note: Phases 2 and 3 may involve randomness, so exact output matching is not guaranteed in those cases.)
